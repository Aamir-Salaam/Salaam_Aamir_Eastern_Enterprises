Code for assignment tasks given by Eastern Enterprises
Kindly download the entire solution and open in Visual Studio 2017+.
To run any Task follow these example patterns (these are just examples):
[Task_Name].exe sum 1,2,3
that is 
[Task_Name].exe sum [arguements]
OR
[Task_Name].exe add \\;\\1;2;5
OR
[Task_Name].exe multiply 3,4
Kindly ignore the Calculator project with Calculator class library as it is in no way relevant to any of the task, I created it with some other workflow in mind but then I decided to follow different workflow.
